Hey everyone! I've been seeing quite a few people staring this library recently! 
This whole setup was my excursions into machine learning and data science. 
if you are trying to learn to feel absolutely free to play with the code! 
If you have ANY questions about any of the code, especially since I've improved my style a lot since writing it all, feel free to email me at coreyohulse@gmail.com
I'll try to answer any questions about the code and if requested enough I could go back, comment, and maybe restyle all the old code to make it a lot more readable.
The main project right now I'm doing is making AI agents that learn to play connect 4. The most recent thing I've added to that is the Game Master that runs tournaments between test agents.
Over time I'll add in the learning agent soon enough and it will work with any type of learning algorithms you want! So you can see how they all learn in competitive environments!
Have fun!
